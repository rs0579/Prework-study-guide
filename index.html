        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML can be broken down into Elements, Tags, and Attributes.</li>
          <li>The <b>!Doctype</b> tells the browser what type of website to expect - not case sensitive</li>
          <li>The <b>Head</b>, which contains Metadata that is invisible to end users, is composed of several tags and elements</li>
          <li>Among these are the elements: <b>Meta, Base, Link, title, and Style</b></li>
          <li>Meta can be broken down even further to: <b>Character set, http-equiv, keywords, Viewport, description, and author</b></li>
          <li>I've come up with my own acronym for this <b><i>Kvaud</i></b> (sounds like a Slavic beverage)</li>
          <li>Then there's the <b>body</b>, which is made of the bulk of the information on a website</li>
          <li>Using HTML, you can add pictures to your structure: <b>img src="location" alt="description"</b></li>
          <li>There are numbered <b>headers(h1, h2..3..), paragraphs(p), lists(ul/ol/li), sections, breaks(b /), etc.</b></li>
          <li>The larger the number next to the h for hearders, the smaller the title/subtitle
          <li>The paragraph is for normal text in the form of a paragraph. You open the element, enter, then write your text. The you enter and close the element</li>
          <li>The <b>li</b> is used to create bullets for a bullet point list</li>
          <li>The <b>ul</b> is to introduce that a list is coming, normal semantic element I think, like: <i>h, img, section etc.</i></li>
          <li>We will eventually learn about footers</li>
          <li>To end an element, you have to put open arrow bracket, slash, tag then close arrow bracket</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a stylistic language, used to beautify webpages</li>
          <li>CSS is all about margins, spacing, justification, color, etc.</li>
          <li>It seems that there will be lots of measurements and technical things there + color</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three main types of CSS: Incline, Internal Stylesheet and Externl Stylesheet</li>
          <li>The incline is the most cumbersome because you have to add CSS attributes to each and every specific element/tag. Unlike the Stylesheets</li>
          <li>The other two are added to the head - External Stylesheet is the one mostly used</li>
          <li>When put in the head, the stylesheets are generalized for the entire page</li>
          <li>The External is linked to the page in the head using the (Arrow1-link-Arrow2) element</li>
          <li>That is to say that the CSS External Stylesheet is a separate document with its own code that you link to the site in the head</li>
          <li>that should look like: **ARROW1-link rel="stylesheet" href="location of stylesheet"ARROW2**</li>
          <li>"rel" stands for the relationship the following thing will have to the webpage</li>
          <li>"href" is the reference point, where the information is stored</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All commands in the CLI that are meant to communicate with GitHub must be prefixed with the git prefix</li>
          <li>You have to clone a repo from an org's GitHub onto your local enviornment (personal device) to create an IDE using the SSH link section</li>
          <li>To do so, on the CLI, under the directory you choose, type **git clone SSH Link**</li>
          <li>A directory feels like a folder to me, and in CLI you can: make them (mkdir _new name_) open files (start _name_), travel between directories (cd _name_) and back one (cd ..)</li>
          <li>You can also create files by typing in the command line **touch _new name_.txt/docx/ops etc.</li>
          <li>The command Git checkout -b _new branch name_ creates a new branch for you to work on code from</l1>
          <li>Always work from a new branch as to avoid tampering with main</li>
          <li>**Git status** tells you where you are in repo, whether your in the main branch or any of the feature branches</li>
          <li>This point isn't so clear to me. Either you do the the **git add -A** then **git commit -m "Description of what was done"**</li>
          <li>To ensure that you have up-to-date code, before you launch a PR, put into GitBash command-line **Git pull origin main enter**</li>
          <li>Once you know that, you can sync your changes org's repo by typing **git push origin _branch name_</li>
          <li>Note to self: NEVER MISS SPACES! IT COULD DETER YOU GREATLY</li>
