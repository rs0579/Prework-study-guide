        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML can be broken down into Elements, Tags, and Attributes.</li>
          <li>The !Doctype to the browser the type of website it should expect and this is not case sensitive</li>
          <li>The Head, which contains Metadata that is invisible to end users, is composed of several tags</li>
          <li>Among these tags are the elements: Meta, Base, Link, title, and Style</li>
          <li>Meta can be broken down even further to: Character set, http-equiv, keywords, VP, descrip, and author</li>
          <li>Then there's the body, which is made of the bulk of the information on a website</li>
          <li>There are also images which follow a set pattern (img src="location" alt="description")</li>
          <li>There are numbered headers(h1..2..3..), paragraphs(p), lists(ul/ol/li), sections, breaks(b /), etc.</li>
          <li>We will eventually learn about footers</li>
          <li>To end an element, you have to put open arrow bracket, slash, tag then close arrow bracket</li>

          <li>All commands in the CLI that are meant to communicate with GitHub must be prefixed with the git prefix</li>
          <li>You have to clone a repo from an org's GitHub onto your local enviornment (personal device) to create an IDE using the SSH link section</li>
          <li>To do so, on the CLI, under the directory you choose, type **git clone SSH Link**</li>
          <li>A directory feels like a folder to me, and in CLI you can: make them (mkdir _new name_) open files (start _name_), travel between directories (cd _name_) and back one (cd ..)</li>
          <li>You can also create files by typing in the command line **touch _new name_.txt/docx/ops etc.</li>
          <li>The command Git checkout -b _new branch name_ creates a new branch for you to work on code from</l1>
          <li>Always work from a new branch as to avoid tampering with main</li>
          <li>**Git status** tells you where you are in repo, whether your in the main branch or any of the feature branches</li>
          <li>This point isn't so clear to me. Either you do the the **git add -A** then **git commit -m "Description of what was done"**</li>
          <li>To ensure that you have up-to-date code, before you launch a PR, put into GitBash command-line **Git pull origin main enter**</li>
          <li>Once you know that, you can sync your changes org's repo by typing **git push origin _branch name_</li>
          <li>Note to self: NEVER MISS SPACES! IT COULD DETER YOUR GREATLY</li>
