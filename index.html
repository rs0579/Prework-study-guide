        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML can be broken down into Elements, Tags, and Attributes.</li>
          <li>The <b>!Doctype</b> tells the browser what type of website to expect - not case sensitive</li>
          <li>The <b>Head</b>, which contains Metadata that is invisible to end users, is composed of several tags and elements</li>
          <li>Among these are the elements: <b>Meta, Base, Link, title, and Style</b></li>
          <li>Meta can be broken down even further to: <b>Character set, http-equiv, keywords, Viewport, description, and author</b></li>
          <li>I've come up with my own acronym for this <b><i>Kvaud</i></b> (sounds like a Slavic beverage)</li>
          <li>Then there's the <b>body</b>, which is made of the bulk of the information on a website</li>
          <li>Using HTML, you can add pictures to your structure: <b>img src="location" alt="description"</b></li>
          <li>There are numbered <b>headers(h1, h2..3..), paragraphs(p), lists(ul/ol/li), sections, breaks(b /), etc.</b></li>
          <li>The larger the number next to the h for hearders, the smaller the title/subtitle
          <li>The paragraph is for normal text in the form of a paragraph. You open the element, enter, then write your text. The you enter and close the element</li>
          <li>The <b>li</b> is used to create bullets for a bullet point list</li>
          <li>The <b>ul</b> is to introduce that a list is coming, normal semantic element I think, like: <i>h, img, section etc.</i></li>
          <li>We will eventually learn about footers</li>
          <li>To end an element, you have to put open arrow bracket, slash, tag then close arrow bracket</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a stylistic language, used to beautify webpages</li>
          <li>CSS is all about margins, spacing, justification, color, etc.</li>
          <li>It seems that there will be lots of measurements and technical things there + color</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three main types of CSS: Incline, Internal Stylesheet and Externl Stylesheet</li>
          <li>The incline is the most cumbersome because you have to add CSS attributes to each and every specific element/tag. Unlike the Stylesheets</li>
          <li>The other two are added to the head - External Stylesheet is the one mostly used</li>
          <li>When put in the head, the stylesheets are generalized for the entire page</li>
          <li>The External is linked to the page in the head using the (Arrow1-link-Arrow2) element</li>
          <li>That is to say that the CSS External Stylesheet is a separate document with its own code that you link to the site in the head</li>
          <li>that should look like: **ARROW1-link rel="stylesheet" href="location of stylesheet"ARROW2**</li>
          <li>"rel" stands for the relationship the following thing will have to the webpage</li>
          <li>"href" is the reference point, where the information is stored</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All commands in the CLI that are meant to communicate with GitHub must be prefixed with the git prefix</li>
          <li>You have to clone a repo from an org's GitHub onto your local enviornment (personal device) to create an IDE using the SSH link section</li>
          <li>To do so, on the CLI, under the directory you choose, type **git clone SSH Link**</li>
          <li>A directory feels like a folder to me, and in CLI you can: make them (mkdir _new name_) open files (start _name_), travel between directories (cd _name_) and back one (cd ..)</li>
          <li>You can also create files by typing in the command line **touch _new name_.txt/docx/ops etc.</li>
          <li>The command Git checkout -b _new branch name_ creates a new branch for you to work on code from</l1>
          <li>Always work from a new branch as to avoid tampering with main</li>
          <li>**Git status** tells you where you are in repo, whether your in the main branch or any of the feature branches</li>
          <li>This point isn't so clear to me. Either you do the the **git add -A** then **git commit -m "Description of what was done"**</li>
          <li>To ensure that you have up-to-date code, before you launch a PR, put into GitBash command-line **Git pull origin main enter**</li>
          <li>Once you know that, you can sync your changes org's repo by typing **git push origin _branch name_</li>
          <li>Note to self: NEVER MISS SPACES! IT COULD DETER YOU GREATLY</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>One of the top three cornerstone langauges, Javascript is used to add logic to your site</li>
          <li>Control Flow in JS is the order that things will occur. It is always from top to bottom unless you create conditions that will allow things to go out of order.</li>
          <li>Javascript is composed of <b>variables</b>. Variables are like containers that store code</li>
          <li>There are several variable declarations, among which we have <b>const</b> (Constant). These never change! Once they're in, that's it.</li>
          <li>When entering code for the const, follow this pattern: <i>variable declaration + the variable = "string";</i>. <b>N.B. </b>All the spaces are super important, do not forget them!!</li>
          <li>The <b>sting</b> is the content of the variable, what the variable defines about the variable</li>
          <li>This is best demonstrated thusly: <i>const shape = "rhombus";</i></li>
          <li>To reiterate, to write a variable you need: <b>variable declaration + the actual variable + = + "the string**";</b> **(description of the variable).</li>
          <li>JS lines should end with a semicolon at the end of the line AFTER the closing quotation mark!</li>
          <li>An <b>array</b> is the same as above, except that in the string section, there are multiple values (pieces of data)</li>
          <li>An example of this would be, using the same shape example: <i>cont shapes = ["triangle," "square," "cicle"];</i> <b>N.B.</b> The brackets and each value is in quotes and separated with a comma and space</li>
          <li>Each value has a number associated with it. The numbers go in order starting from 0.</li>
          <li>These numbers are called indeces (index)</li>
          <li>For Loops require a three part set up to function: <b>1. open parenthesis x = index number; x greater than variable.length; x++ close parethesis space <i>open curly bracket</i> enter WRITE CODE BLOCK enter <i>close curly bracket</i></b>.</li>
          <li>This is how it should be looking: <i>for(let x = 1; x < shape.length; x++) {}</i>.</li>
          <li>x = index number... .length = full amount of values in the array... x++ = x+1.</li>
