# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project was completed as part of the prework for the Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. This assessment was completed as a means of familiarizing me with the basics of the cornerstone languages (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) in preparation for the more complex subject-matter to come. During this process, I have become equipped with the necessary coding capabilities in order to format a simple HTML page along with the varying aspects of coding in this language, CSS external style sheet construction and the meaning of the various elements within its composition, finishing the prework modules with JavaScript variables, arrays, For Loops and functions. I have not merely acquired basic coding skills, throughout these lessons, I have also learned technical industry jargon, applying those terms throughout the learning process. My evaluation of these lessons is that they have served as an invaluable introduction to the field of Software Development and the notes I have taken are an indication of this.

## Usage

I intend for this webpage to be used as a buidling block of study materials that will be utilized throughout the initial beginning learning stages. The webpage is divided into four sections, each devoted to a major concept: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. There are detailed notes regarding these concepts in order to facilitate information retention. Furthermore, by opening the Chrome DevTools, one remarks the JavaScript running.
